# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`
Install the required libraries in package.json
### `npm run build`
This command builds the app for production to the build folder and correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. It also registers the service worker. Run the command and the output from the terminal should look like something below.
### `npm install -g serve`
Run the app with the aid of a static server.
### `serve -s build`
To run the build folder on a static server. Your application should be up and running at http://localhost:5000. So how do we check if a site is a PWA? We can do that by checking the service worker section in the Application tab in the Developer tools.
